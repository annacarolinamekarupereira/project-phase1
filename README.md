This page is simulator of the Sorting Hat from Hogwards, from the Harry Potter Wizard World.

The app is very simple to use and intuitive. All you need to do is select the best match for your personality type and The Hat will show you which house you would be allocated, as well as find out who would be your mentor and the location of your common room for your first year in Hogwarts.
